### Welcome to my little corner of the Internet! üåê
It's crazy to think that not so long ago, the Internet was a fledgling, niche technology, but now it's so simple for someone like me to create and share on the Internet. Thankfully for this exponential technological growth, but I think it's due time to develop more of these revolutionary ideas! Luckily, I have a few things on my side:
- I'm a high school junior (16 y/o) in the USA
    - Entering college in Fall 2022, hopefully studying applied physics, aerospace engineering, or computational science
- I LOVE thinking and learning about space, rocketry, evolutionary biology, computational sciences (especially physics!), social studies (especially geography, history), emerging technologies and futurism... I could go on and on!
- I have been into computer science since I was 10 (yes, I was a Scratch kid), and I have been programming since I was 12. I have lots of breadth of knowledge and pride myself on being able to learn quickly:
    - I am comfortable working with: C#, Java, JavaScript (Node.js, React)
    - I have exposure and have basic skill in: F#, Python, C++
    - To learn: 
        - Languages: Rust + Go (what's with all the hype?!), C (memory management terrifies me, but I need to confront this fear ASAP), R (data analysis is fascinating, but I want to study enough statistics first), TypeScript (jQuery, advanced React features + large-scale web apps)
        - Topics to explore: Linux system architecture, embedded systems + IoT, networking + cybersecurity, robust and fast desktop + mobile UX (there are so many 'modern frameworks' but sadly, they all seem slow or extremely limited), blockchain, machine learning, large-scale web applications (also how to use new web technologies to provide desktop-like experiences in browser)... again, I could go on and on!
            - I find the Linux command line extremely interesting and hope to use + develop command line utilities in the near future. Good command-line programs seem difficult but oh so satisfying, simple, and fast to use!
            - If you are experienced in these topics or are similarly interested, email me!
